# Proto4X
Hobby dev of a 4X strategy game.

## Vision
*(in a perfect world, this is probably not viable without being very simplistic in most areas)*

Complex and rich simulation of 4X style game, where all 'empires' are typically fully AI controlled
- AI is a layered hierarchy where each layer is approximated by npc characters (e.g. ship captain, fleet admiral, planetary governer, president/emperor)
- AI 'difficulty' defined by skills/abilities of character. Characters can change role, causing a new AI module created based off character abilities

Player is a character like all other npcs, and can switch role
- Switch role is probably time limited, i.e. can only switch role every X years, or on special conditions, to force some investment/attachment to the position and to limit desire to micromanage and control everything when in broad scope
- Switching role trades scope for direct control (scope being single ship vs planet/system/sector vs empire)
- Emperor cannot command individual ships or manage planets in detail, but can give fleets broad orders (e.g. defend this system or frontier, harass enemy trade(pirate)) and control research and empire level diplomacy
- Sectors/planets also control their own diplomacy/research with options for different interpretation of orders or outright rebellion
